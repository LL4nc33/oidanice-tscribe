# OidaNice TScribe Configuration
# Copy to .env and adjust values for your environment.
#
# WHY env vars: 12-Factor App methodology - config varies between deploys
# (dev/staging/prod) but code does not. Environment variables keep secrets
# out of version control.

# --- API ---
# Enable debug mode (verbose logging, auto-reload)
TSCRIBE_DEBUG=false

# --- Database ---
# WHY SQLite: Zero-config, single-file database. Perfect for single-server
# deployments. Path is relative to the container's working directory.
TSCRIBE_DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:////data/tscribe.db

# --- Redis ---
# WHY redis://redis:6379: "redis" resolves to the Redis container via
# Docker Compose networking. Use localhost:6379 for local development.
TSCRIBE_REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# --- Whisper (Transcription Engine) ---
# Model size: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3
# WHY base as default: Good accuracy/speed tradeoff. ~1GB VRAM.
# Use "large-v3" for production quality (requires ~6GB VRAM).
TSCRIBE_WHISPER_MODEL=base

# Device: auto, cpu, cuda
# WHY auto: Detects NVIDIA GPU automatically, falls back to CPU.
TSCRIBE_WHISPER_DEVICE=auto

# Compute type: int8, float16, float32
# WHY int8: ~50% less VRAM with minimal quality loss.
# Use float16 on GPU for best quality/speed balance.
TSCRIBE_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8

# --- Storage ---
# Hours before completed jobs and temp files are cleaned up.
# WHY 24h: Gives users time to download results without filling disk.
TSCRIBE_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_HOURS=24
